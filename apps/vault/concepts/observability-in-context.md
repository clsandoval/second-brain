# Observability in Context

## Definition

LLM observability is the practice of gathering telemetry data while an LLM-powered system is running to analyze, assess, and enhance its performance. It provides full visibility and tracing in an LLM application system, automatically surfacing issues and enabling developers to monitor, debug, and optimize AI applications.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Monitoring and Tracing
- **Latency**: Response time for individual requests and components
- **Throughput**: Number of requests processed over time
- **Error rates**: Frequency and types of failures
- **Token usage**: Input and output tokens consumed
- Capture inputs, outputs, and metadata for each intermediate step
- Track execution flow through complex agent systems

### 2. Evaluation and Quality Metrics
- Model-based evaluations (LLMs evaluating other LLMs)
- User feedback (ratings, comments)
- Manual labeling (human review)
- Automated metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Quality dimensions: factual accuracy, relevance, coherence, safety, hallucination detection

### 3. Context Analysis and Debugging
- Analyze which context elements affected outputs
- Track [[context-engineering|context]] evolution across agent steps
- Identify context poisoning or distraction issues
- Debug context window management

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Cost per request (token usage and API costs)
- Cache hit rates (efficiency of caching strategies)
- Retry patterns (failure recovery effectiveness)
- Tool usage (which tools agents call and when)

## Best Practices

### Implementation Strategies
- Start early: implement observability from development, not just production
- Use comprehensive platforms covering tracing, evaluation, and debugging
- Implement incremental tracing progressively as complexity grows
- Capture full interaction context, not just inputs/outputs

### Evaluation Strategies
- Define metrics upfront before building
- Use multiple evaluation methods (automated + human review)
- Continuous evaluation in production
- Track user feedback from real interactions

### Debugging Workflows
- Trace from user intent to final output
- Isolate components and test individually
- Compare versions with A/B testing
- Log context evolution across agent steps

## How It Relates

- **[[context-engineering]]**: Provides feedback loop for measuring and optimizing context strategies
- **[[retrieval-augmented-generation]]**: Monitor retrieval quality and relevance scores
- **[[spec-driven-development]]**: Validate implementations meet specifications
- **[[context-compression-pruning]]**: Measure compression-quality tradeoffs
- **[[tool-abstraction-portability]]**: Track tool usage patterns and effectiveness

## Key Technologies

- [[langfuse]]: Most used open source LLM observability tool
- Datadog LLM Observability: End-to-end tracing of chains and agents
- MLflow Tracing: Integrates with 20+ GenAI libraries

## Real-World Applications

### Development Phase
- Prompt engineering: test and optimize prompts with metrics
- Context engineering: evaluate different context strategies
- Tool selection: determine which tools improve performance
- Architecture decisions: compare different RAG or agent patterns

### Production Monitoring
- Real-time alerting for anomalies
- User behavior analysis
- Performance regression detection
- Cost tracking and optimization

### Continuous Improvement
- Identify edge cases from production data
- Refine prompts using real-world data
- Optimize context based on effectiveness metrics
- Fine-tune evaluations based on feedback
- Track context evolution in [[agentic-context-engineering|ACE]]-based systems
