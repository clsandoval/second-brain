# Temporal

## Overview

Durable execution platform that enables developers to write workflows as regular code while automatically handling state persistence, failures, and recovery. Infrastructure-level orchestration for complex, long-running workflows.

## Core Features

- **Durable Execution**: Automatic state preservation at every workflow step
- **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in retry mechanisms, seamless recovery from failures
- **Long-Running Workflows**: Run for days, weeks, or months without losing progress
- **Event Sourcing**: Full replayable workflow history
- **Multi-Language Support**: Go, Java, TypeScript, Python native SDKs
- **Built-in Primitives**: Task queues, signals, timers, compensating transactions (Saga pattern)
- **Observability**: Complete visibility into workflow executions

## Comparison to Celery

| Feature | Celery | Temporal |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Architecture | Stateless task queue | Stateful workflow orchestration |
| Use Cases | Short-lived, independent tasks | Multi-step, long-running business processes |
| Language Support | Python-focused | Multi-language (Go, Java, TS, Python) |
| Fault Tolerance | Basic retries via broker | Durable event logs, full replay |
| State Management | Manual persistence required | Automatic state capture |
| Duration | Minutes to hours | Hours to months |

## When to Use Temporal vs Celery

- **Use Celery**: Simple async tasks (image processing, emails), Python-only projects, existing Redis/RabbitMQ infrastructure
- **Use Temporal**: Multi-step AI agent workflows (RAG, tools), complex business logic with state, distributed workflows, cross-language orchestration

## Use Cases in Context Engineering

- AI pipeline orchestration (multi-model, multi-step processing)
- Agent workflows requiring state persistence and reliability
- Human-in-the-loop AI processes (approval workflows, review cycles)
- Long-running data processing pipelines
- Durable transaction tracking and compensation logic
- Orchestrating [[context-engineering|context]] across long-running processes

## Deployment Options

- 100% open-source (MIT licensed)
- Self-hosted or Temporal Cloud
