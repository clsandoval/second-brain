# Context Compression Pipeline Example

## Overview

Example implementation of a multi-stage context compression pipeline for handling long documents in LLM applications.

## Architecture

```
Long Document (50k tokens)
    ↓
Chunking (into 5k token chunks)
    ↓
Relevance Ranking (semantic similarity)
    ↓
Select Top-K Chunks (keep most relevant)
    ↓
LLMLingua Compression (20x reduction)
    ↓
Final Context (2.5k tokens)
    ↓
LLM Generation
```

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Chunking
- Split document into semantic chunks
- Preserve paragraph/section boundaries
- Overlap between chunks for context continuity

### Stage 2: Relevance Ranking
- Embed query and all chunks
- Calculate cosine similarity
- Rank chunks by relevance score
- Apply reranking model for improved accuracy

### Stage 3: Selection
- Select top-k chunks based on scores
- Balance between coverage and token budget
- Dynamic k based on available context window

### Stage 4: Compression
- Apply [[context-compression-pruning|LLMLingua]] to selected chunks
- Target compression ratio (e.g., 10x-20x)
- Preserve key entities and facts
- Remove redundant information

### Stage 5: Quality Check
- Validate compressed context maintains key information
- Check compression ratio achieved
- Verify readability and coherence

## Metrics to Track ([[observability-in-context]])

- **Input tokens**: Original document size
- **After selection**: Tokens after top-k selection
- **After compression**: Final context size
- **Compression ratio**: Input/output token ratio
- **Relevance score**: Average similarity of selected chunks
- **Quality score**: LLM evaluation of compressed vs original
- **Latency**: Time for full pipeline
- **Cost**: API calls and compute

## Use Cases

- Legal document analysis (contracts, case law)
- Medical record processing (patient histories)
- Research paper summarization (literature review)
- Long conversation history management (chatbots)
- Multi-document question answering

## Technologies Used

- [[context-compression-pruning]]: Core compression techniques
- [[langfuse]]: Monitor compression effectiveness
- [[retrieval-augmented-generation]]: Often used together with RAG

## Context Engineering Integration

Implements the **[[context-engineering#Compress]]** strategy:
- Reduce token usage while retaining critical information
- Enable processing of documents larger than context window
- Optimize cost and latency

## Performance Expectations

- **Compression Ratio**: 10x-20x typical
- **Latency Reduction**: 20-30% in generation time
- **Quality Maintenance**: <5% degradation with proper tuning
- **Cost Reduction**: Proportional to compression ratio
