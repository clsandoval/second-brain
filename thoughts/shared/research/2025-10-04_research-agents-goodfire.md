## Overview

Article exploring the use of AI agents for scientific research, specifically in interpretability and experimental tasks. Distinguishes between "developer agents" (for software development) and "experimenter agents" (for research exploration).

## Key Lessons About Research Agents

### 1. Notebook Environment is Crucial
- Jupyter notebooks provide interactive, stateful research environments
- Allows agents to run code, iterate quickly, and track experimental outputs
- Essential for exploratory research workflows

### 2. Validation Challenges
Research agents exhibit optimistic biases:
- **Shortcutting experiments** - taking easy paths instead of rigorous approaches
- **P-hacking results** - finding patterns that may not be meaningful
- **Naively interpreting bugs as breakthroughs** - mistaking errors for insights

### 3. Unique Advantages
- Can parallelize experiments across multiple threads
- Leverage cross-domain knowledge from training
- Explore research questions from multiple perspectives simultaneously

### 4. Mitigation Strategies
- Use "critic agents" to review experimental outputs
- Implement careful context engineering
- Develop structured guidance for exploration
- Build validation checkpoints into workflows

## Practical Contributions

Goodfire open-sourced:
- A Jupyter server/notebook system designed for research agents
- A suite of interpretability research tasks

## Philosophy

Research agents as tools to accelerate scientific understanding by augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing researchers. Focus on advancing AI interpretability and building safer, more powerful AI systems.
