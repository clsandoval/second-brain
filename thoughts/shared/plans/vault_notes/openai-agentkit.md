# Vault Notes Plan: OpenAI AgentKit

## Research Summary

OpenAI launched **AgentKit** on October 6, 2025, at DevDay 2025 in San Francisco. AgentKit is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and evaluating AI agents through a visual-first interface. The platform was demonstrated in a live 8-minute build session (YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwGNK1DUFsM) where Christina from the OpenAI team built and deployed a fully functional agent for the DevDay website.

### Key Findings from Research

**What AgentKit Is:**
- A complete toolkit for developers to build, deploy, and optimize AI agents
- Built on top of OpenAI's Responses API (their new agent-focused API primitive)
- Visual-first development environment described by Sam Altman as "like Canva for building agents"
- Competes with LangChain/LangGraph (code-first frameworks), AutoGPT (autonomous agents), and no-code tools (n8n, Zapier, Make)

**Major Components:**
1. **Agent Builder** (Beta) - Visual drag-and-drop workflow designer with nodes for agents, routing, tools, guardrails, and logic
2. **ChatKit** (GA) - Framework-agnostic embeddable chat interface for deploying agents
3. **Widget Builder** - Custom UI component creation for rich agent interactions
4. **Guardrails** (Open-source) - Safety layer with PII detection, moderation, jailbreak prevention, and hallucination detection
5. **Connector Registry** (Beta) - Enterprise data governance for managing connections across organizations
6. **Evals for Agents** (GA) - Comprehensive evaluation platform with trace grading, datasets, and automated prompt optimization

**Real-World Impact:**
- Ramp: 65% codebase reduction, 70% iteration speed improvement, migrated 3 agents in 5 days
- Klarna: Support agents handle 2/3 of all tickets
- Clay: 10× growth with sales agent optimization
- Development time cut by 50% for multi-agent frameworks
- Agent accuracy increased by 30% for Evals users

**Technical Foundation:**
- Built on Responses API (combines simplicity of Chat Completions with tool-use of Assistants API)
- Code export to Python and TypeScript via Agents SDK
- Native MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for tool integration
- Full versioning and rollback capabilities
- Inline evaluation and testing

- `apps/vault/tech/openai-responses-api.md` - Underlying API architecture
- `apps/vault/tech/model-context-protocol.md` - Tool integration standard

- Technical integrations: Langfuse, Braintrust, Temporal demos

---

## Scope Decision

### Recommended Approach: Single Comprehensive Note

AgentKit is a unified platform where all components work together as an integrated system. While some components (ChatKit, Guardrails) have standalone repositories, they are primarily designed to work within the AgentKit ecosystem.

**Rationale for single note:**
- All components released together as a unified product at DevDay 2025
- Deeply integrated: Widget Builder outputs are used in Agent Builder, which deploys via ChatKit, protected by Guardrails, evaluated by Evals
- Cannot meaningfully use most components independently
- Similar platforms (LangGraph, Claude Agent SDK, Letta) are documented as single comprehensive notes in the vault
- The video demonstrates building a complete agent using multiple components together in one workflow
- Separating would create fragmentation and lose the platform's cohesive narrative

**Note:** The vault already has a separate note for **OpenAI Agents SDK** (the code-first programmatic approach), so AgentKit (the visual-first platform) should have its own comprehensive note.

### Note to Create:

**OpenAI AgentKit** (`apps/vault/tech/openai-agentkit.md`)
- **Type**: technology
- **Rationale**: AgentKit is a complete development platform/toolkit from OpenAI for visually building AI agents and deploying them with integrated evaluation and governance

      - Agents SDK = Code-first development (Python/TypeScript/Go)
    - Both built on Responses API foundation
    - Code export bridges visual and programmatic approaches
    - Responses API combines Chat Completions simplicity with Assistants API tool-use

    - Human-in-the-loop workflows with approval nodes
    - Research agents with file search and web search tools
    - Customer support automation (Klarna example)
    - Sales and procurement agents (Clay, Ramp examples)
    - Example from video: DevDay assistant with specialized agents (session agent + dev day agent) using classifier routing

13. **Comparison to Other Frameworks**
    - **vs. LangGraph**:
      - AgentKit: Visual-first, 2-3 day learning curve, integrated deployment (ChatKit), OpenAI-focused
      - LangGraph: Code-first, explicit graph structures, vendor-agnostic (100+ LLMs), deep customization
      - When to choose: AgentKit for rapid iteration and enterprise integration; LangGraph for multi-model flexibility

    - **vs. AutoGPT**:
      - AgentKit: Structured node-based workflows, explicit control, enterprise-ready
      - AutoGPT: Autonomous exploration, maximum AI autonomy, experimental
      - When to choose: AgentKit for production; AutoGPT for exploratory autonomy
    - **vs. No-code tools (n8n, Zapier, Make)**:
      - AgentKit: AI-native workflows, intelligent routing, advanced reasoning, LLM integration
      - n8n/Zapier: Traditional automation, API integrations, rule-based logic
      - Sam Altman positioning: "like Canva for building agents" - directly competing with no-code automation

## Index Update Required

**Yes** - Add OpenAI AgentKit to the vault index at `apps/vault/README.md`

**Suggested placement:**

Under **Technologies** section, in the **Development** or **Agent Frameworks** subsection:

```markdown
### Agent Frameworks & Platforms
- [[openai-agentkit]] - Visual-first platform for building, deploying, and evaluating AI agents
- [[openai-agents-sdk]] - Code-first SDK for building multi-agent systems
- [[claude-agent-sdk]] - Anthropic's agent development framework with MCP
- [[langgraph]] - Graph-based agent orchestration framework
- [[letta]] - Memory-augmented agent platform
```

## Additional Considerations

**Relationship to OpenAI Agents SDK:**
The vault already has a separate note for OpenAI Agents SDK (code-first approach). The relationship should be clearly documented:
- AgentKit = Visual-first platform with Agent Builder
- Agents SDK = Code-first programmatic framework
- Both built on Responses API
- Code export feature bridges the two approaches
- Different learning curves: AgentKit 2-3 days, SDK 5-7 days (based on user reports)

**Beta Status:**
Agent Builder and Connector Registry are currently in beta. The note should acknowledge this and may need updates as features reach GA.

**Pricing Transparency:**
Include available pricing details (ChatKit storage, File Search queries, Computer Use tokens) but note that full enterprise pricing may not be publicly documented.

**Migration Guidance:**
While not creating a full migration guide, mentioning that code export enables moving from visual to code-first workflows is valuable for users planning their agent development strategy.

**MCP Integration:**
AgentKit's native MCP support is a significant differentiator. Emphasize the three types (hosted, local, HTTP) and how this enables tool portability across platforms.

**Versioning and Iteration:**
The snapshot-based versioning system is important for production deployments. Highlight how each publish creates a rollback point.

**Evaluation Integration:**
The tight integration between Agent Builder and Evals (inline configuration, trace grading) is a key workflow advantage over separate tools.

**Widget Customization:**
The natural language widget creation feature is unique and worth emphasizing as a differentiator from other platforms that require manual UI code.

**Enterprise Focus:**
The Connector Registry and Guardrails indicate OpenAI's enterprise focus. This positioning should be clear in the note.

**Community and Ecosystem:**
Note the emerging ecosystem: Temporal integration demos, Langfuse tracing, Composio guides, community MCP servers.
