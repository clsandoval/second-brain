# Vault Notes Plan: LangGraph

## Research Summary

Based on comprehensive research including web searches, vault exploration, and thoughts directory analysis, LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building stateful, multi-agent AI systems with graph-based workflows. Key findings:

**From Web Research:**
- Official GitHub repository: github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph (19.4k stars, 3.4k forks, 268 contributors)
- Built by the LangChain team as a lower-level alternative to LangChain's higher-level abstractions
- Production-proven: Used by LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna (documented in "Top 5 LangGraph Agents in Production 2024")
- Key differentiators: Durable execution, graph-based workflows, comprehensive state management, human-in-the-loop capabilities
- Installation: `pip install -U langgraph`
- Active development with extensive documentation at langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/

**From Vault Analysis:**
- LangGraph is mentioned across 14 existing vault files but doesn't have its own dedicated note yet
- Referenced in [[context-engineering]] as a tool for orchestrating context across agent workflows
- Listed in [[retrieval-augmented-generation]] for orchestrating complex agentic RAG workflows
- Mentioned in [[research-agents]] for multi-step research workflows with decision points
- Positioned alongside other orchestration tools: [[temporal]] (infrastructure workflows), [[letta]] (agent memory)

**From Thoughts Directory:**
- Found in `thoughts/shared/research/2025-10-03_09-58-41_vault-expansion-scraper.md`
- Cataloged as "agent orchestration" technology
- Distinguished from Temporal (durable workflows) and LangChain (higher-level framework)

**Existing Relationships Identified:**
- Implements "Isolate" strategy from [[context-engineering]] (multi-agent systems with separate context)
- Enables [[agentic-rag-workflow]] and [[research-agents]] patterns
- Integrates with [[langfuse]] (observability), [[composio]] (tools), [[letta]] (memory)

## Scope Decision

### Recommended Approach: Single Note

LangGraph should be documented as a single technology note because:
- It is a distinct, cohesive framework with clear boundaries (not a broad concept)
- All features relate to the same core purpose: graph-based agent orchestration
- Natural fit for the technology note template (has GitHub, docs, website)
- Already has established identity separate from LangChain
- All aspects (architecture, features, multi-agent patterns, integrations) fit together naturally

### Note to Create:

**LangGraph** (`apps/vault/tech/langgraph.md`)
- **Type**: technology
- **Rationale**: Specific orchestration framework with distinct features, active development, and production adoption

### Structure

1. **Overview**
   - Clear definition: Low-level orchestration framework for building stateful, multi-agent AI systems
   - Relationship to LangChain: Built by same team, lower-level vs higher-level abstractions
   - Core value proposition: Durable execution, graph-based workflows, production-ready
   - When to use LangGraph vs alternatives

2. **Core Architecture**
   - **Graphs**: Directed graphs representing agent workflows (StateGraph, MessageGraph)
   - **Nodes**: Individual functions or operations (tools, LLM calls, retrieval steps, human input)
   - **Edges**: Connections between nodes (conditional routing, loops, branches)
   - **State**: Shared state object that flows through the graph (TypedDict, Pydantic models)
   - **Checkpointing**: Automatic state persistence for durability and time-travel debugging

3. **Key Features**
   - Durable execution that persists through failures (crash recovery, resumability)
   - Human-in-the-loop capabilities (approval gates, feedback loops, interrupts)
   - Comprehensive memory management (short-term conversation state, long-term knowledge)
   - Multi-agent system support (network, supervisor, hierarchical architectures)
   - Streaming support for real-time outputs
   - Time-travel debugging (replay from any checkpoint)
   - Built-in observability hooks

4. **Multi-Agent Architectures**
   - **Network Pattern**: Peer-to-peer agent collaboration, agents communicate directly
   - **Supervisor Pattern**: Centralized orchestration with supervisor agent routing tasks
   - **Hierarchical Pattern**: Nested teams with managers and workers, delegation chains
   - When to use each pattern (complexity, coordination needs, autonomy levels)
   - Examples from production (LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna case studies)

5. **Use Cases in Context Engineering**
   - Implements "Isolate" strategy from [[context-engineering]] (separate agent contexts)
   - Orchestrates complex [[agentic-rag-workflow]] patterns (routing, retrieval, generation)
   - Enables [[research-agents]] with multi-step workflows (hypothesis, experiment, validate)
   - Manages context across agent boundaries (state passing, memory sharing)
   - Production examples: Multi-agent research, code generation pipelines, customer service

6. **Integration Ecosystem**
   - **[[langfuse]]**: Observability and tracing for LangGraph workflows
   - **[[composio]]**: Tool integrations (3000+ tools accessible to agents)
   - **[[letta]]**: Agent memory and state management (persistent memory across sessions)
   - **LangChain**: Higher-level components (chains, retrievers, prompts)
   - **LangSmith**: Evaluation and monitoring platform
   - Multi-model support: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-source models

7. **Comparison with Alternatives**
   - vs **Temporal**: Temporal for infrastructure workflows (microservices, distributed systems), LangGraph for agent workflows (LLM orchestration, AI reasoning)
   - vs **AutoGen**: AutoGen research-grade, LangGraph production-ready with better state management
   - vs **CrewAI**: CrewAI role-based abstractions, LangGraph lower-level graph control
   - vs **LangChain**: LangChain higher-level chains, LangGraph explicit state and routing

8. **Resources**
   - Official documentation and tutorials
   - GitHub repository and examples
   - Community resources (Awesome-LangGraph)
   - Blog posts and case studies
   - Getting started guide

### Key Content Points

**Definition & Value:**
- "LangGraph is a low-level framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications with LLMs by modeling workflows as graphs" (from official docs)
- Production-ready framework with 19.4k+ GitHub stars
- Built by LangChain team specifically for complex agent orchestration needs
- Designed for applications requiring explicit state management and complex control flow

**Core Architecture Details:**
- StateGraph: Define nodes (functions), edges (transitions), and shared state
- State is a TypedDict or Pydantic model that flows through the graph
- Nodes receive state, perform operations, return state updates
- Edges can be conditional (based on state) or fixed (always follow)
- Checkpointing automatically saves state at each step for durability
- Can compile graphs into runnable applications

**Key Features with Specifics:**
- **Durable Execution**: Automatic checkpointing, resume from any point, crash recovery
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: `.interrupt()` for approval gates, `.update_state()` for feedback
- **Memory**: Built-in conversation memory, integration with vector stores for long-term memory
- **Multi-Agent**: Network (peer-to-peer), Supervisor (central router), Hierarchical (nested teams)
- **Streaming**: Real-time token streaming, progress updates, intermediate results
- **Debugging**: Time-travel through checkpoints, visualize graph structure, trace execution

**Multi-Agent Patterns:**
- **Network**: Agents communicate directly, best for collaborative tasks with equal peers
- **Supervisor**: Central supervisor routes to specialist agents, best for task delegation
- **Hierarchical**: Teams of teams with managers, best for complex organizational structures
- Production example: LinkedIn uses supervisor pattern for code review workflows

**Context Engineering Applications:**
- Implements "Isolate" strategy: Each agent has separate context, prevents pollution
- Parallel agent execution reduces latency and token usage
- State management enables long-horizon tasks (research, code generation)
- Human-in-the-loop prevents autonomous errors in production

**Integration Examples:**
- Langfuse integration: Add decorators for automatic tracing and observability
- Composio integration: Access 3000+ tools (Slack, GitHub, Gmail) via function calling
- Letta integration: Persistent memory across conversation sessions
- LangSmith integration: Evaluation datasets, A/B testing, performance monitoring

**Comparison Points:**
- Temporal: Infrastructure-focused (durable workflows for microservices), LangGraph: AI-focused (agent reasoning)
- AutoGen: Research-grade flexibility, LangGraph: Production-grade reliability
- CrewAI: Role-based abstractions (simple), LangGraph: Graph-based control (flexible)
- LangChain: High-level chains (quick prototyping), LangGraph: Low-level graphs (complex orchestration)

## Index Update Required

Yes - Add LangGraph to `apps/vault/index.md` under the Technologies section:

```markdown
## Technologies

- [[tech/claude-code|Claude Code]]: Agentic coding tool for terminal-based development
- [[tech/composio|Composio]]: Tool integration platform for AI agents
- [[tech/flyio|Fly.io]]: Global application deployment platform
- [[tech/langgraph|LangGraph]]: Low-level orchestration framework for stateful multi-agent systems
- [[tech/letta|Letta]]: Agent memory and state management platform
- [[tech/onyx|Onyx]]: Enterprise RAG with 40+ knowledge source connectors
- [[tech/temporal|Temporal]]: Durable execution platform for workflows
```

## Additional Considerations

**Positioning:**
- LangGraph occupies a unique space: lower-level than LangChain, more production-ready than AutoGen, more flexible than CrewAI
- Best positioned as "production orchestration for complex agent workflows"
- Emphasize state management and durable execution as key differentiators

**Dependencies:**
- No new notes need to be created - all referenced concepts and technologies already exist
- This note will be referenced by future agent-related notes

**Migration Notes:**
- No existing vault notes need updating - LangGraph references are already accurate
- Future notes on specific agent patterns should link to this note

**Edge Cases:**
- LangGraph vs LangChain distinction is important - emphasize throughout
- Multi-agent patterns need clear "when to use" guidance to be actionable
- Integration section should be concise - detailed integration steps belong in example notes
